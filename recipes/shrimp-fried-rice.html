    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here’s a weeknight dinner that gives us that cozy feeling every time we make it: Shrimp Fried Rice! It’s over the top delicious and total comfort food. Follow this recipe and it’s the path to shrimp fried rice that’s easy and irresistibly tasty. The garlic, ginger and soy sauce meld perfectly with the colorful veggies, bursts of shrimp and gooey bits of egg into a symphony of flavor. It’s one of my favorites for weeknight cooking…ever.</p>
